Hi, I’m Junjie Xia, a fifth-year Ph.D. candidate in Chemistry at the University of Chicago. I graduated from Zhejiang University (Hangzhou, China) with a bachelor’s degree in Polymer Materials & Engineering before pursuing doctoral training.

My research focuses on developing novel single-cell and spatial multi-omic technologies, with an emphasis on next-generation proteomics to study protein–protein interactions (PPIs) and protein post-translational modifications (PTMs). I developed Glycan Proximity Sequencing (GPS), which enables the integrated measurement of proteins, glycans, protein-specific glycoforms, and mRNA in single cells. I also created Spatial Proximity Sequencing (SProx) to dynamically profile protein abundance and interactions within intact tissues.

I bridge wet-lab assay development (antibody/protein conjugation, flow cytometry, NGS workflow) with computational analysis (Python, R) to uncover mechanistic insights into immune regulation and identify protein biomarkers. Beyond academia, I am passionate about translational applications of single-cell and spatial technologies in disease diagnosis, biomarker discovery, and liquid biopsy, and I am actively exploring opportunities in biotech, pharma, and data science.

Before starting my Ph.D., I gained experience in venture capital investment at Kaitai Capital (Biomedicine and Healthcare Department), where I evaluated cell-based therapies, benchmarked emerging modalities such as epigenetic therapeutics and aptamer–drug conjugates, and contributed to investment decisions through due diligence analyses and pitch materials. This experience strengthened my interest in the intersection of biotechnology innovation, commercialization, and investment strategy.

Outside of research, I enjoy working out, playing basketball, snowboarding, music, movies, and poker.
