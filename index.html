<!DOCTYPE html PUBLIC "-//W3C//DTD HTML 4.0 Transitional//EN" "http://www.w3.org/TR/REC-html40/loose.dtd"> <html><body> <p>Hi, I’m <strong>Junjie Xia</strong>, a fifth-year Ph.D. candidate in <strong>Chemistry at the University of Chicago</strong>. I graduated from <strong>Zhejiang University (Hangzhou, China)</strong> with a bachelor’s degree in <strong>Polymer Materials &amp; Engineering</strong> before pursuing doctoral training.</p> <p>My research focuses on developing <strong>novel single-cell and spatial multi-omic technologies</strong>, with an emphasis on next-generation proteomics to study <strong>protein–protein interactions (PPIs)</strong> and <strong>protein post-translational modifications (PTMs)</strong>. I developed <strong>Glycan Proximity Sequencing (GPS)</strong>, which enables the integrated measurement of <strong>proteins, glycans, protein-specific glycoforms, and mRNA</strong> in single cells. I also created <strong>Spatial Proximity Sequencing (SProx)</strong> to dynamically profile <strong>protein abundance and interactions</strong> within intact tissues.</p> <p>I bridge <strong>wet-lab assay development</strong> (antibody/protein conjugation, flow cytometry, NGS workflow) with <strong>computational analysis</strong> (Python, R) to uncover mechanistic insights into <strong>immune regulation</strong> and identify <strong>protein biomarkers</strong>. Beyond academia, I am passionate about <strong>translational applications</strong> of single-cell and spatial technologies in <strong>disease diagnosis, biomarker discovery, and liquid biopsy</strong>, and I am actively exploring opportunities in <strong>biotech, pharma, and data science</strong>.</p> <p>Before starting my Ph.D., I gained experience in <strong>venture capital investment at Kaitai Capital (Biomedicine and Healthcare Department)</strong>, where I evaluated <strong>cell-based therapies</strong>, benchmarked emerging modalities such as <strong>epigenetic therapeutics</strong> and <strong>aptamer–drug conjugates</strong>, and contributed to investment decisions through due diligence analyses and pitch materials. This experience strengthened my interest in the intersection of <strong>biotechnology innovation, commercialization, and investment strategy</strong>.</p> <p>Outside of research, I enjoy <strong>working out, playing basketball, snowboarding, music, movies, and poker</strong>.</p> </body></html>
